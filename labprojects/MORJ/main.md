Patentted for commercial use. [Pattent nÂ°FR3121999](https://data.inpi.fr/brevets/FR3121999?q=Jost-Mousseau#FR3121999)  
If you are a company and are interested in this device, please contact us. Our main goal is to make devices of this type more easily available to neuroscience researchers users, even without the hassle of developping their own in-lab. We have no financial interest to this pattent, which is held by CNRS (French Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique). The pattent can be a great tool to access institutionnal fundings allowing translation from research to industry and in-fine, to lower the cost of commercialization and developpement for your company.
